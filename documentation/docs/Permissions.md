All permissions should be really intuitive, most of them are simply:

> clans.<command_name\>.<sub_command_name\>

Luckperms permission tab completion will help you.

For admin only actions **clans.admin.*** is used.

Here's a list of all permission plugin has (can be outdated, please contact me or do a PR if it is)
