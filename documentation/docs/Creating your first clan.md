Okay, plugin is installed in working on your server, right? Fun starts here.

To create your first clan, type a command:
> /clan create <tag\> \[display_name\]

Technically, clan has two names: A tag and a display name. Defining a display name is optional.
A tag is a short clan identifier. Only english letters and numbers are allowed. Maximum tag size is 16, and 2 is minimum.

Display name is, well, a display name of the clan. There's no limitations, and you even can use decorations from [MiniMessage](https://https://docs.adventure.kyori.net/minimessage/format.html).

## Inviting members

To invite members, use
> /clan invite <player\>

Player will recieve an invitation from you. To accept it, they would use
> /clan accept <sender\>

or, to decline

> /clan decline <sender\>

We created a clan and now we have members. Amazing.
