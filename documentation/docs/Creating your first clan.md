Okay, plugin is installed in working on your server, right? Fun starts here.

To create your first clan, type a command:
> /clan create <display_name\>

Technically, clan has two names: A tag and a display name.
A tag is a short clan identifier. Display name is what players see in chat. 
By default, plugin will make a tag from display name for you, but if you wanna explicitly set it, use --tag flag:
> /clan create <red>Bloody --tag bloody



In display name, you can use [MiniMessage](https://docs.adventure.kyori.net/minimessage/format.html) decorations.

## Inviting members

To invite members, use
> /clan invite <player\>

Player will recieve an invitation from you. To accept it, they would use
> /clan accept <sender\>

or, to decline

> /clan decline <sender\>

We created a clan and now we have members. Amazing.
