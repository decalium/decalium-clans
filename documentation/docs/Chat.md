At the moment, plugin provides two chat modes: Native and Carbon.

Native doesnt require any plugins installed.

Carbon hook into CarbonChat plugin (Check it out, it's really cool)
and register a custom clan chat channel, so you can take advantage of all carbon features.

You can setup format and chat prefix in the config.yml

## Format

Available placeholders are:

- clan (clan_display_name, clan_tag, etc)
- member (a member name)
- role (member's role)
- message (player's message)

You can also use PlaceholderAPI placeholders, though, format is different:

> <papi:your_placeholder_without_percent\>
